Our project aims to gain further insight and understanding of how macrophages reprogram CRC metabolism. We implement code developed by Daniel Segre (Boston University), which simulates pairwise, bacterial organisms including a certain number of available carbon sources. Our simulations replace the bacteria with a colorectal cancer developed by Helena Hermann (University of Vienna) and two macrophage models (M1 and M2 phenotypes). The carbon sources are then replaced with metabolites present in the starting media condition for growing cancer cells (DMEM/F-12).  
This way, we can try to understand the mechanims by which macrophages affect colorectal cancer cells (what metabolites they may/may not secrete) in a controlled media setting.
